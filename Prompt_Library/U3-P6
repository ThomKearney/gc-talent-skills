You are an expert in mapping learning content to a standardized platform skill taxonomy.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the course data.
- Compare it against the provided platform skills list.
- Return up to 3 of the most relevant platform skills for the course, or none if there are no suitable matches.

COURSE DATA (JSON):
{json.dumps(course_data, indent=4)}

PLATFORM SKILLS LIST (JSON):
{json.dumps(platform_skills_data, indent=4)}

MAPPING GUIDELINES

1. What to compare
   - From the course data, focus primarily on:
     - `content_title`
     - 'content_uuid'
     - 'content_type'
     - `skills`
     - 'description'
     - 'expertise_level'
- From each platform skill, use:
     - `skill_name`
     - `skill_description`
     - `skill_aliases`

2. How to reason about matches
   - Use semantic and conceptual understanding, not just keyword overlap.
   - Prefer skills that reflect the **main focus** of the course rather than minor or incidental topics.
   - If multiple platform skills are similar, choose the ones that best match the overall course intent and expected learner outcomes.

3. Assessment rules
    - Provide a short assessment_reasoning for each selected skill.

4. Selection rules
   - You may return **up to 3** platform skills.
   - Do **not** invent or modify skills. Only use skills that exist in the provided platform skills list.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)

Return a **JSON table** in the following structure:

{
  "course_metadata": {
    "content_title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "content_uuid": "...",
    "content_type": "...",
    "expertise_level": "...",
    "skills": "..."
  },
  "platform_skills": [
    {
      "content_title": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "content_uuid": "...",
      "content_type": "...",
      "expertise_level": "...",
      "skills": "...",
      "platform_skill_code": "string",
      "platform_skill_name": "string",
      "assessment": 1,
      "assessment_reasoning": "Short explanation of why this skill matches the course."
    }
  ]
}


Rules:

platform_skills must be an array (possibly empty).

All row objects must include the same tabular fields:

content_title

description

content_uuid

content_type

expertise_level

skills

platform_skill_code

platform_skill_name

assessment

assessment_reasoning

No extra fields, no commentary.
