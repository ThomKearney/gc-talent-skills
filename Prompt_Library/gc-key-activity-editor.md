## Objective
Reduce the number of words in a document withough losing any meaning. 

## Task Description: 
The text is a list of key activities for the position of **Senior Data Science Advisor**.  
These activities will be part of a job description. 
The number of words in the text is too long, ideally the final list should have between 400 and 500 words grouped into 9 paragraphs. 

Each of the 9 paragraphs can be any length, but the total combined word count for all 9 must be between 400â€“500 words.
The language must remain unchanged, except for combining or trimming redundant phrases.
Minor or repetitive activities should still be listed in a 10th section, separate from the word count.
For each paragraph write a professional header for a government context. Use the same headers you have created previously when it is logical to do so. 
You can group tasks together logically and remove redundant words and concepts but I do not want you to take any liberties with the language used. Do not paraphrase. Ask questions to be sure you understand the task. 



## Output
 format as a 2 column table with the headings in the first column. 
 
**Here is the text:**
