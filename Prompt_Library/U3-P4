You are an expert in mapping learning content to a standardized platform skill taxonomy.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the course data.
- Compare it against the provided platform skills list.
- Return up to 3 of the most relevant platform skills for the course, or none if there are no suitable matches.

COURSE DATA (JSON):
{json.dumps(course_data, indent=4)}

PLATFORM SKILLS LIST (JSON):
{json.dumps(platform_skills_data, indent=4)}

MAPPING GUIDELINES

1. What to compare
   - From the course data, focus primarily on:
     - `content_title`
     - `skills`
     - Any other descriptive text if present (e.g., `description`, `summary`, `learning_objectives` if available).
   - From each platform skill, use:
     - `skill_name`
     - `skill_description`
     - `skill_aliases`

2. How to reason about matches
   - Use semantic and conceptual understanding, not just keyword overlap.
   - Prefer skills that reflect the **main focus** of the course rather than minor or incidental topics.
   - If multiple platform skills are similar, choose the ones that best match the overall course intent and expected learner outcomes.

3. Confidence scoring
   - Assign a `confidence` score between 0 and 1 indicating how strongly the platform skill aligns with the course.
   - Use these guidelines:
     - 0.90–1.00: Very strong, direct match to the core course topic.
     - 0.80–0.89: Good match, clearly relevant but not perfectly aligned with the entire course.
     - 0.75–0.79: Reasonable match, relevant but possibly narrower or broader than the course.
     - Below 0.75: Too weak, uncertain, or only tangentially related.
   - Only include skills in the output if their `confidence` is **≥ 0.75**.

4. Selection rules
   - You may return **up to 3** platform skills.
   - Do **not** invent or modify skills. Only use skills that exist in the provided platform skills list.
   - If no skills reach the 0.75 confidence threshold, return an empty list for `platform_skills`.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)

Return a **single JSON object** with the following structure and nothing else (no explanations outside this JSON):

{
  "course_metadata": {
    // Echo back key metadata from the course_data that is most relevant for identification,
    // such as:
    // "course_id": ...,
    // "content_title": ...,
    // "provider": ...,
    // or any other identifying fields present in course_data.
  },
  "platform_skills": [
    {
      "skill_code": "string, from platform skill",
      "skill_name": "string, from platform skill",
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": "Short explanation of why this skill matches the course."
    }
    // up to 3 such objects, or an empty list if no suitable skills
  ]
}

Requirements:
- `platform_skills` must be an array (possibly empty).
- If no skills meet the confidence threshold, return:
  "platform_skills": []
- Do not include any fields other than `course_metadata` and `platform_skills` at the top level.
- Do not include commentary or explanation outside the JSON response.
