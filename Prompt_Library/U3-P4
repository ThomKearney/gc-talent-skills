You are an expert in mapping learning content to a standardized platform skill taxonomy.

Your task is to:
- Analyze the course data.
- Compare it against the provided platform skills list.
- Return up to 3 of the most relevant platform skills for the course, or none if there are no suitable matches.

COURSE DATA (JSON):

PLATFORM SKILLS LIST (JSON):
{json.dumps(platform_skills_data, indent=4)}

MAPPING GUIDELINES

1. What to compare
   - From the course data, focus primarily on:
     - `content_title`
     - `skills`
     - Any other descriptive text if present (e.g., `description`, `summary`, `learning_objectives` if available).
   - From each platform skill, use:
     - `skill_name`
     - `skill_description`
     - `skill_aliases`

2. How to reason about matches
   - Use semantic and conceptual understanding, not just keyword overlap.
   - Prefer skills that reflect the **main focus** of the course rather than minor or incidental topics.
   - If multiple platform skills are similar, choose the ones that best match the overall course intent and expected learner outcomes.

3. Confidence scoring
   - Assign a `confidence` score between 0 and 1 indicating how strongly the platform skill aligns with the course.
   - Use these guidelines:
     - 0.90–1.00: Very strong, direct match to the core course topic.
     - 0.80–0.89: Good match, clearly relevant but not perfectly aligned with the entire course.
     - 0.75–0.79: Reasonable match, relevant but possibly narrower or broader than the course.
     - Below 0.75: Too weak, uncertain, or only tangentially related.
   - Only include skills in the output if their `confidence` is **≥ 0.75**.

4. Selection rules
   - You may return **up to 3** platform skills.
   - Do **not** invent or modify skills. Only use skills that exist in the provided platform skills list.
   - If no skills reach the 0.75 confidence threshold, return an empty list for `platform_skills`.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)

<details> <summary><strong>OUTPUT FORMAT (CLICK TO EXPAND)</strong></summary>

Return a single table with the following structure and nothing else (no explanations outside the table):

Output Table Requirements

The table must contain:

Two required rows:

course_metadata

platform_skills

Additional rows for each matched platform skill (up to 3).

Columns:

field_name — identifies the category or skill

skill_code — platform skill code (blank for course_metadata)

skill_name — platform skill name (blank for course_metadata)

confidence — confidence score (blank for course_metadata)

notes — short explanation

assessment — 1 if included, 0 if not included

If no platform skills meet the 0.75 threshold:

The platform_skills row must still appear with assessment = 0

No additional skill rows are included

REVISED OUTPUT TEMPLATE
field_name	skill_code	skill_name	confidence	notes	assessment
course_metadata				(insert relevant course metadata here)	1
platform_skills				(summary statement: number of matched skills or “none”)	1
Skill 1 (if any)	SC-XXX	Name	0.xx	Reason for match	1
Skill 2 (if any)	SC-XXX	Name	0.xx	Reason for match	1
Skill 3 (if any)	SC-XXX	Name	0.xx	Reason for match	1

Notes:

All rows must appear in a single table.

Empty values should be left blank, not omitted.

If no skills qualify, the table should contain only the first two rows, with assessment for platform_skills = 0.
