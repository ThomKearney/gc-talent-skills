Measurement systems encompass the conditions, devices, and the human element of measurement, which together must produce correct measurements and comply with appropriate standards. Measurement error, or measurement variability, is a problem whose components must be thoroughly understood and kept in check to maintain the effectiveness of any measurement system. Measurement variability contributes to the overall variability in the process and it is important to understand its sources and minimize it. Black Belts can calculate correlation, bias, linearity, stability, reproducibility, and repeatability to analyze and further improve measurement systems.\nThis course examines how to analyze a measurement system to help it produce correct measurements and minimize its proportion of variability in the overall variability. It introduces key elements of metrology and international systems of measurement, explores the many sources of measurement error, and surveys a broad range of items that can be measured in various functional areas of the enterprise. The course also presents some of the considerations influencing the use of measurement systems in service industries. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft&#39;s ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.","content_uuid":"","content_type":"Course","skills":["Measurement Systems","Measurement Systems Analysis","Measurement Techniques","Measurement Tools"],"platform_skills":[{"skill_name":"Analytical Thinking","skill_description":"Demonstrated ability to interpret, link and analyze information in order to understand issues.","skill_id":"ANAL-THK","skill_families":["Thinking Skills"],"category":"Thinking Skills","platform_skill_id":"ANAL-THK","platform_skill_name":"Analytical Thinking","reasoning":"The course emphasizes analyzing measurement systems and understanding variability, which aligns with the ability to interpret and analyze information to understand issues."},{"skill_name":"Attention to Detail","skill_description":"Demonstrated ability to pay close attention to all elements of an activity or product, identify any gaps or incomplete components, find inaccuracies and inconsistencies, and ensure that the task is completed in full according to the requirements.","skill_id":"AT-D","skill_families":["Personal Behaviours"],"category":"Personal Behaviours","platform_skill_id":"AT-D","platform_skill_name":"Attention to Detail","reasoning":"The course focuses on minimizing measurement variability and ensuring correct measurements, which requires precision and attention to detail."},{"skill_name":"Problem Solving","skill_description":"Demonstrated ability to identify the source of an issue, and find and implement an effective solution.","skill_id":"PROB-SOL","skill_families":["Thinking Skills"],"category":"Thinking Skills","platform_skill_id":"PROB-SOL","platform_skill_name":"Problem Solving","reasoning":"The course involves identifying sources of measurement error and implementing solutions to improve systems, which aligns with problem-solving skills."}]},{"content_title":"How to REALLY Use LinkedIn, Second Edition","description":"This title was removed from the Skillsoft library.","content_uuid":"","content_type":"Book","skills":["Career Development","Content Creation","Lead Generation","Professional Communication"],"platform_skills":[{"skill_name":"Mentoring","skill_description":"Demonstrated ability to provide advice, guidance, and support to individuals to aid in their professional development.","skill_id":"MENT","skill_families":["Leadership - General Technical Skills"],"category":"Leadership - General Technical Skills","platform_skill_id":"MENT","platform_skill_name":"Mentoring","reasoning":"The course focuses on professional communication and career development, which align with mentoring skills such as providing guidance and support for professional growth."},{"skill_name":"General Communication","skill_description":"Demonstrated ability to receive, understand, develop, and share information in a clear, logical, respectful manner through verbal, visual and written interactions with others.","skill_id":"GEN-COM","skill_families":["Communication Skills"],"category":"Communication Skills","platform_skill_id":"GEN-COM","platform_skill_name":"General Communication","reasoning":"Professional communication is a key skill listed in the course, and general communication encompasses the ability to share information effectively, which is essential for LinkedIn usage."},{"skill_name":"Analytical Thinking","skill_description":"Demonstrated ability to interpret, link and analyze information in order to understand issues.","skill_id":"ANAL-THK","skill_families":["Thinking Skills"],"category":"Thinking Skills","platform_skill_id":"ANAL-THK","platform_skill_name":"Analytical Thinking","reasoning":"Lead generation and career development require analytical thinking to interpret data and identify opportunities, making this skill relevant to the course's focus."}]},{"content_title":"Pro Puppet, Second Edition","description":"Puppet provides a way to automate everything from user management to server configuration.
