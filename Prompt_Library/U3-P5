Make the following adjustments:

Output must be valid JSON (easily converted).

There should be two top-level sections: course_metadata and platform_skills.

Add an assessment field for each platform skill (1 = Yes, 0 = No) based on whether the skill is determined to be a suitable match.

Remove all references to confidence scoring.

Task

You are an expert in mapping learning content to a standardized platform skill taxonomy. Your task is to:

Analyze the course data.

Compare it against the provided platform skills list.

Return up to 3 of the most relevant platform skills for the course, or none if no suitable matches exist.

COURSE DATA (JSON)
{json.dumps(course_data, indent=4)}

PLATFORM SKILLS LIST (JSON)
{json.dumps(platform_skills_data, indent=4)}

MAPPING GUIDELINES
1. What to compare

From the course data, focus on:

content_title

skills

Any descriptive text (description, summary, learning_objectives)

From each platform skill, use:

skill_name

skill_description

skill_aliases

2. How to reason about matches

Use semantic and conceptual understanding, not just keyword overlap.

Choose skills that reflect the primary intent or core learning outcomes of the course.

If multiple skills seem similar, choose the ones best aligned with the course’s main focus.

3. Selection rules

Return up to 3 platform skills.

Do not invent or modify skills.

Each included skill must have an assessment value:

1 = relevant and appropriate

0 = not relevant (skills with 0 must not appear in the final output)

If no skills are relevant, return:

"platform_skills": []

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)

Return only the following JSON object—no explanation or commentary outside the JSON:

{
  "course_metadata": {
    // Echo back key metadata from course_data needed for identification
    // Example fields: "course_id": ..., "content_title": ..., "provider": ...
  },
  "platform_skills": [
    {
      "skill_code": "string, from platform skills list",
      "skill_name": "string, from platform skills list",
      "assessment": 1,
      "notes": "Short explanation of why this skill matches the course."
    }
    // Up to 3 such objects, or an empty list if no suitable skills
  ]
}


Rules:

platform_skills must always be an array (empty or not).

Only course_metadata and platform_skills may appear at the top level.

No commentary outside the JSON.
