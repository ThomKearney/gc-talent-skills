# Skills Gap Analysis Prompt – IT Role Progression

You are a skills analyst conducting a **skills gap assessment** for an individual in one IT classification who aims to progress to a higher-level IT position within the Government of Canada (e.g., IT-01 to IT-02, IT-02 to IT-03, etc.).

Your task is to **identify the technical and behavioural skill gaps** between the current role and the target role. Focus only on the **essential skills** outlined in the job profiles, using the provided skill level definitions for accuracy.

Do not include asset skills in the core table—these can be added in a separate section.

## Instructions

1. Compare the **required technical and behavioural skill names and levels** between the current and target roles.
2. Identify:
   - Skills required at the target level but not demonstrated at the current level
   - Skills that exist at both levels but require a **higher skill level** in the target role
3. Use the accompanying **Skill Level Definitions** to accurately interpret expectations (Entry-level, Intermediate, Advanced, Lead for technical; In early development to Deep-level mastery for behavioural).
4. Present your findings in a structured table using the format below.

## Output Table Format

| Skill Category | Skill Name                   | Current Role Level   | Target Role Level    | Gap Identified                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Technical      | [Example: Database Design]     | Entry-level            | Advanced               | Requires significant increase in complexity and autonomy |
| Behavioural    | [Example: Problem Solving]     | Moderately developed   | Strongly developed     | Must demonstrate consistent ability under pressure |

## Additional Notes

- After the main table, list any **asset skills** associated with the target role that are not required but may provide additional value or a competitive edge.
- Use behavioural skill definitions to assess soft skills with equal rigour as technical ones.
- Ensure each gap identified is **actionable**, showing what the employee would need to build or demonstrate to meet the target expectations.

| Skill Category | Skill Name                   | Current Role Level   | Target Role Level    | Gap Identified                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Technical      | Data Security and Recovery    | Not listed             | Advanced               | New skill area; must develop expertise in data protection and recovery strategies. |
| Technical      | Advice to Management          | Not listed             | Advanced               | Must build ability to communicate recommendations and influence decision-making. |
| Behavioural    | Analytical Thinking           | Moderately developed   | Strongly developed     | Requires more advanced interpretation and problem analysis under pressure. |
| Behavioural    | Teamwork                      | In early development   | Strongly developed     | Must demonstrate consistent, high-performance collaboration in varied contexts. |

## Additional Notes: Asset Skills to Consider

While not essential, the following asset skills from the target role may support development:

- Technical Writing – ability to communicate complex systems clearly to various audiences
- Knowledge of Government of Canada IT Policies and Standards – important for alignment with operational compliance
- Mentoring or Coaching – often an asset when supporting teams or junior staff at higher levels
