# Objective  
Your objective is to **analyze the provided Job Description (JD)** in relation to the **Canadian Cyber Security Skills Framework (2022)** and the **NIST.CWSP.** You will evaluate each JD’s degree of alignment with relevant core roles, identify any gaps or inconsistencies, and provide **actionable recommendations** to strengthen alignment and clarity.

- 
### Assess Alignment with the Following NIST Framework Roles:

- **O.G-WRL-010 Cyber Project Manager 

For each role, assess the following:

- **Degree of alignment**: High, Moderate, Low, or None  
- **Identify missing or underrepresented elements**:  
  - Key **competencies**  
  - Core **responsibilities**  
  - Relevant **tools, technologies**, or **contextual elements** as defined in the Framework  

### Step 3: Provide Recommendations  
Suggest **clear and actionable updates** to better align the Job Description with the Framework. Use standard **Government of Canada HR language**, terminology, and classification practices (e.g., clarity of duties, required qualifications, scope of responsibility, autonomy).

# Output Format  

Provide your analysis in a **detailed markdown table** using the format below:

### Example Table Format:  

| **Framework Role** | **Matching Elements in the JD** | **Gaps or Omissions** | **Recommendations** |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **[Insert Core Role Title]** | - Clearly list observed duties or statements from the JD that reflect the role's intent<br>- Use direct quotes or paraphrased language where appropriate | - Identify any missing technologies, competencies, tools, or responsibilities expected under the Framework<br>- Clarify underrepresented dimensions like autonomy, scope, or interdepartmental collaboration | - Recommend concrete updates using GC HR language (e.g., add reference to specific technologies, clarify responsibility boundaries, include collaboration mechanisms, etc.) |
| **[Insert Core Role Title]** | *(Insert observed elements from the JD)* | *(Insert identified gaps or underrepresented areas)* | *(Insert specific, plain-language recommendations)* |
| **[Insert Core Role Title]** | *(Insert observed elements from the JD)* | *(Insert identified gaps or underrepresented areas)* | *(Insert specific, plain-language recommendations)* |

# Additional Notes:
- Include **one row per relevant Framework role**  
- If **no alignment exists**, clearly state “No alignment” and briefly explain why  
- Align all observations and language with the **Cyber Security Skills Framework (2022)** and the **Government of Canada classification standards**  
- Recommendations should reflect best practices in **position design, classification, and role clarity**
